# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction

This project uses **machine learning** to detect plant diseases from uploaded leaf images.  
It identifies the **plant type**, **disease name**, and **cause**, and provides **solutions** to help the plant recover and stay healthy.

### 🧠 Features
- Predicts disease from an uploaded leaf image  
- Displays plant type, disease name, and cause of infection  
- Suggests solutions and prevention steps  
- Supports multiple plant types (Tomato, Potato, Pepper, etc.)

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Streamlit (for web interface)

### 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains labeled leaf images for:
- Tomato  
- Potato  
- Pepper (Bell)  

Each class includes both **healthy** and **diseased** samples.

### 🚀 How It Works
1. User uploads a leaf image.  
2. The trained model predicts the disease label.  
3. The app displays the plant name, disease name, cause, and recovery solutions.

### 📈 Future Improvements
- Add more plant categories  
- Improve model accuracy with larger datasets  
- Enhance user interface for mobile users
